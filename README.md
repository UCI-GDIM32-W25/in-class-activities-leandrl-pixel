# GDIM32 In Class Activities



### Actvity 1
- one piece of advice that I would give is studying while also turning in work ahead of time. by studying youll be 
- able to reflect on what is going on in the class and you wont have to worry with struggling with the work

### Actvity 2 
1. answer = 10 
2. answer = 2 
3. update is a method is called by unity every frame and then be able to print the message of hello world 
4. Monobehaviour
5. using the print message to have a value of 10 but later in the debug log you want it to appear in the console so its there with x
6. 10 is argument, “x = ” + x is connection between string and variable
7. you cant move the transform concept you can only move the specfic object, your trying to call a class name transform. use _playerTranform
8. it should be changed to player transform

### Actvity 3 
- The player, The seed, The UI, The floor
- The cat is able to walk freely in the 2D plane (utilizing WASD - off grid of the screen.) Has the ability to plant down a maximum of 5 flowers. 
- Whenever the seed is planted by the player, the UI showing the amount of seed planted and the amount that the player possesses changes. When a seed is planted, a seed object is drawn on the screen, with a higher layer order than the player and the floor.

### Activity 2

### Actvity 3 
- [MG 5 Progress](https://github.com/leandrl-pixel/HW4/commit/3e41013f6dc67c99a49b7e092092c70974e72589)
- I worked on setting up my unity, adding sprites, ensuring that each sprite was split correctly too, while also adding some things into the scene like birds as well. 

## Week 5 

### Activity 1
- What I think about the design of these interfaces is that it is overall fine but I woyuld have a change in the abstract Item

### Actvity 2 
- The model in the w5demo2 and the scritpable object are Itemw5Demo2 and the other is the EnemyStats that are used in the enemy, play script as well
- represent the internal stat of the enemy, items in the player inventory space, the controllers in the demo scipt detecting input and moves player based on the input rescieved. 


### Activity 3 
Scnario 1: Multi view component with the C# events
Finite state Machine for animation 
Scnario 2: scriptable objects for things like weapons and ablity data. Iherentence for weapon that has an abstract of a class, the MVC with C# events for conroling the event of guns being dispersed in contact with an enemy. 
Finite state Machine for animation the movement like deciding to talk or even run 
scnario 3: scritable objects for things that exist in the space of the world maybe a leaf etc. Multi view components are wher eplayer gets the input and movement view for the inventtory and blueprint for lots of info of the game. ex amount of plants in inventory. 
### Activity 4 
- Attendance Weida chen, Lillian su, Leandro Lopez 
 - [Proprosal Draft Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xISKeTxHcyg1ukxzz-i_5d-Cz9bvp_8rIGGyn6IEIXQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## Week 6 

### Activity 1 
- Notes: circle collider is the most efficent than using a polygon collider, a custom collider on. The fruit with the plain old circle colldier when we run them its going to go a lot better
- try not to use too many rigidbodies 
- To check performance on how each colliders work with your computer and performance use the window analysis and check profiler
- Gizmos can helpdebug easier and without debugging

### Activity 2 
- Attendance: Lillian Su, Leandro
- [Final Proposal Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xISKeTxHcyg1ukxzz-i_5d-Cz9bvp_8rIGGyn6IEIXQ/edit?usp=sharing)
