## Instructions


## Actvity 1
- one piece of advice that I would give is studying while also turning in work ahead of time. by studying youll be 
- able to reflect on what is going on in the class and you wont have to worry with struggling with the work

## Actvity 2 
1. answer = 10 
2. answer = 2 
3. update is a method is called by unity every frame and then be able to print the message of hello world 
4. Monobehaviour
5. using the print message to have a value of 10 but later in the debug log you want it to appear in the console so its there with x
6. 10 is argument, “x = ” + x is connection between string and variable
7. you cant move the transform concept you can only move the specfic object, your trying to call a class name transform. use _playerTranform
8. it should be changed to player transform

## Actvity 3 
- The player, The seed, The UI, The floor
- The cat is able to walk freely in the 2D plane (utilizing WASD - off grid of the screen.) Has the ability to plant down a maximum of 5 flowers. 
- Whenever the seed is planted by the player, the UI showing the amount of seed planted and the amount that the player possesses changes. When a seed is planted, a seed object is drawn on the screen, with a higher layer order than the player and the floor.
