// Willow is building a game and needs your help completing this code.
//
// There are 2 parents and 3 child classes in this game.
// IBreakable is an interface which defines objects that can be damaged and broken.
// Item is an abstract class which defines items that the player can use.
// Axe, ElvenSword, and Torch are all Items, but only the Axe and Torch are IBreakables.
// 	(The ElvenSword cannot be broken because... it's magic.)
// 
// Without changing which of these objects are inheriting from Item and IBreakable,
// fix Willow's compiler errors.
//
// Expected output:

// lighting area with torch
// torch now has 0 durability remaining
// torch is broken!
// attacking with Elven sword
// attacking with axe
// axe now has 4 durability remaining
